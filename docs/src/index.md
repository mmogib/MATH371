## Introduction
`MATH371.jl` is a Julia package designed to implement the pseudocodes covered in the course MATH371 at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). This package serves as a practical tool for students, providing them with the necessary functions to solve textbook exercises and deepen their understanding of numerical computing concepts taught in the course.

The primary goal of MATH371.jl is to facilitate hands-on learning by allowing students to directly apply the theoretical concepts and algorithms discussed in class. By using this package, students can efficiently work through course exercises, experiment with different numerical methods, and gain valuable experience in Julia programming.
